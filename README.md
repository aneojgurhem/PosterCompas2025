Thank you for using this template for your COMPAS 2025 poster submission!

Getting Started:

* Edit only the main.tex file — this is where you'll write your poster
   content.

* Place all figures in the fig/ directory.  There's no need to include
   the fig/ prefix when referencing figures in your LaTeX code — it's
   handled automatically.

* Use the provided \p*{} macros to specify the title, authors,
   affiliations, and other metadata.

You’ll find an example.tex file in the repository, which contains a
fictional poster. Feel free to use it as inspiration for structure,
formatting, and layout ideas.

For any questions, please contact [compas-2025-posters@inria.fr](mailto:compas-2025-posters@inria.fr).

Happy postering!
