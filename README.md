Participants presenting a poster at [Compas 2025](https://2025.compas-conference.fr/) have the *option* to delegate the printing and setup of their poster to the organizers. Those who choose this option must use the template available [here](https://gitlab.inria.fr/compas2025/poster) and submit their poster to [compas-2025-posters@inria.fr](mailto:compas-2025-posters@inria.fr) by **June 8**.

# Getting Started

* Edit only the [main.tex](./main.tex) file — this is where you'll write your poster
   content.

* Place all figures in the [fig/](./fig) directory.  There's no need to include
   the `fig/` prefix when referencing figures in your LaTeX code — it's
   handled automatically.

* Use the provided `\p*{}` macros to specify the title, authors,
   affiliations, and other metadata.

You’ll find an [example.tex](./example.tex) file in the repository, which contains a
fictional poster. Feel free to use it as inspiration for structure,
formatting, and layout ideas.

Happy postering!
